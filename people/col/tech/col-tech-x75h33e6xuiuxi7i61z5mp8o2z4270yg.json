        "summary": "Systems engineer with over 8 years of experience in the software development cycle, from understanding a problem and creating a solution, engaging with clients, to developing and delivering the solution. I have worked in both the public and private sectors, including entrepreneurial endeavors. As a Product Manager, Full Stack Developer, and often a QA with agile methodologies, I've had the opportunity to support the entire software development process by coordinating internal and external teams. As a Product Manager and entrepreneur, I place a strong emphasis on developing strategic agility, planning, and building strong relationships to help achieve our goals. In development, I am well-versed in tools like Node, React, JS, Java, Python, and CR, as well as databases like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. I've found that promoting self-management and long-term thinking within my team is key to optimizing time and efficiency, ultimately leading to better results."
